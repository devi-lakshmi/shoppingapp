### Learning goals
#### Main learning goals:
JS:
- Array iterators (map, filter, find, reduce)
- Using npm to install packages
- Using interactive HTML elements like buttons, forms, and select dropdowns
- Using event listeners and event handlers, like onClick

React:
- Creating components
- Nesting components and passing them data via props
- Managing component local UI state with useState hook
- Using react-router-dom to make static and dynamic routes

Redux:
- Installing and setting up Redux in a React app
- Creating and managing state using Redux stores
- Writing update logic in reducers and actions
- Creating and using selectors to get information from the store
- Writing and using thunks for asynchronous actions like interacting with APIs

#### Additional learning goals include:
- API authentication with Redux
- CSS styling
- Basic git and GitHub usage: making commits, adding remote & pushing to master

### General Tips

- **Read the features carefully!** It is easy to accidentally deviate from the features, resulting in a frustrating experience. Taking the time to read the requirements can save you time and effort.
- **Don't get stuck for too long!** If you feel stuck, try taking a small walk, continuing on to a next step, or talking out loud about the problem you're facing (programmers call this "rubber-ducking"). Everybody can get stuck, but don't let it stop you.
- **Focus on the required features first!** Before moving to the bonus features of this assessment, focus on implementing the required parts, then move on to the next ones.

# What are we building?
The goal of this assessment is to build a shopping app. It has a few main pages, where users should be able to browser products, add them to their cart, and view their carts. See the Features list and API details below for all the details

### Wireframes
You can use the following design wireframes as an inspiration:
- <a href="https://p-928eb7.f4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/eDu6bGEd/webshop_project.png?v=771138ac1a5cbaf3cb2eb6b3ae90c425">Design 1</a>
- Don't worry about the looks of your app, we will not take it into account when grading you!

### Tip- Spend an hour planning:
  - The structure of the Redux store and initial state
  - How many slices? 
  - What actions will you need?
  - What selectors will you need?
  - What thunks will you need?
  - What pages and components will you need? 

# Features
- Required features are marked with ❗️
- Product data must come from the API
- You must use Redux for global state management

> Hint: There are many, many ways you can implement the below features. For one possible solution, it might help to review [this example](https://github.com/TechmongersNL/fs03-react/blob/react-lifting-state/src/components/character-list.js#L10-L24) from our React Harry Potter app. We took some data from an API, added our own "likes" data on top of it, and then stored that all in our state 😉

## Product features 🍎

# API
## Setup
You will be running this backend API locally on your own computers
- You can find the backend API here: https://github.com/TechmongersNL/redux-webshop-backend/tree/master
- `Git clone <ssh link>` the repo above
- `Cd` into the repo, then run `npm install`
- In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will start the local backend server
- To access the API, use `http://localhost:4000` as the base URL for all your requests. For example, to get a list of products, you would use `http://localhost:4000/products`

## Endpoints
